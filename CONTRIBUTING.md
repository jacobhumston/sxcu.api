## Setting up...

Create your development folder, then run the following commands:
```console
cd <development folder>
git clone https://github.com/Lovely-Experiences/sxcu.api.git .
```

Then all you have to do is run the following command:
```
npm ci
```

If you run `npm install` you will likely install new versions, which we do not want.

Once you are finished with your changes, create a pull request!
